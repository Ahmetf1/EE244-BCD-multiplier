# BCD Multiplier Schematic Design

In the project, it is aimed to design a BCD multiplier that multiplies a 2-digit BCD number with a 1-digit BCD number and returns the result as 3-digit BCD number. In addition, a seven-segment decoder that convert a BCD number to a seven-segment form aimed to design. All the circuit elements expected to be properly functioning in the simulation.

## Design and Method
In order to accomplish desired task, a circuit with main components such as BCD to Binary Decoder, Binary Multiplier, Binary to BCD Encoder and BCD seven segment decoder is designed. It is preferred to convert BCD numbers to binary numbers then multiplying the binary numbers. Because, in that way calculations become simpler. As the input the circuit takes 3 BCD number and produces 3 number in the seven-segment decoded form.
